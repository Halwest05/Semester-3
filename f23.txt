	2- Maintenence of intracellular pH
	3- Maintenence of ionic composition
	4- Generation of ionic gradient necessary for electrical excitabilty of nerve and muscles. 
	5- Excretion of waste products and toxic substances

Determine boundaries of heart: {CVS}
	Right border: right atrium and superior, inferior vena cavae
	Left border: left ventricle and portion of left atrium
	Superior Border: Both atria
	Inferior Border: Mainly right ventricle 

Dif between primary and secondary healing: {MOD}
	Feature			Pimary			Secondary

	Cleanliness		Clean			Unclean
	Infection		Generally uninfected	Maybe Infected
	Sutures			Used			Not Used
	Margins			Surgical clean		Irregular
	Outcome			Linear scar		Irregular wound

Contents of the middle mediastinum: {CVS}
	Ans/ The middle mediastinum consists of pericardial sac containing the heart and its blood vessels (coronary vessels) and the roots of the aorta, superior and inferior vena cavae and pulmonary vessels.

Classify and define muscle groups according to their actions: {MSK}
	1- Agonists: Prime movers
	2- Antagonists: Oppose prime movers
	3- Synergists: Help prime movers
	4- Fixators: Stablize primer movers action

Numerate the source of origin that lead to development of the skeletal muscle: {MSK}
	1- Paraxial mesoderm
	2- Lateral plate mesoderm
	3- Neural crest cells

Enumerate 4 causes of generalized edema: {MPS}
	1- Increased Extracellular fluid
	2- High local venous pressure
	3- Lymphatic obstruction
	4- Low plasma oncotic pressure/ Serum albumin
	5- Increased capiliary permeability

Interpret 4 physiological cause of peripheral cyanosis and enumerate 2 causes of central cyanosis: {MPS}
	1- Cold exposure
	2- Redistribution of blood flow to the extremities
	3- Reduced cardiac output
	4- Arterial obstruction
	5- Venous obstruction

	1- Impaired pulmonary function
	2- Impaired oxygen diffusion
	3- Alveolar hypoventilation

Enumerate the static factors that are responsible for the stability of the shoulder joint: {MSK}
	Ans/ Humeral head, glenoid arc, labrum, intracapsular ligament, extracapsular ligament

Mention mechanism of neutrophils migration: {MOD}
	1- Neutrophil adhesion and emigration due to binding of complementary adhesion molecules on endothelial and neutrophil surfaces.
	2- Chemical mediators change surface expression or avidity of adhesion molecules:
		a- Selectins
		b- Immunoglobulins
		c- Integrins

What are the most important membrane transport mechanisms involved in the control of intracellular Na+, K+, Ca+2 concentration: {MR}
	1- Na+/K+ Pump
	2- PMCA (Plasma membrane ca2+ atpase)
	3- SERCA (Sarco endoplasmic reticulum atpase)
	4- NCX (Sodium calcium exchanger)
	5- NHE (Sodium hydrogen exchanger)
	6- Mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporters

The membrane potential is restored rapidly to resting levels in nerve and muscle cells after an action potential. how is this achieved: {MR}
	Ans/ By inactivation of Na+ channels, and opening K+ channels. Thus K+ move outward which bring the internal charge back to negative charge.

Short note about conducting system: {CVS}
	ANS/ The heart conduction system is a network of nodes that controls heartbeat. main parts of the system are ((SA, AV) node, bundle of HIS, bundle branches, purkine fibers.

Dif between acute and chronic inflammation: {MOD}
	Feature			Acute			Chronic
	
	Onset			Fast			Slow
	Cellular infiltrate	Mainly neutrophils	Monocytes,lymphocytes and macrophages
	Tissue injury		Usually mild		Maybe severe
	Signs			Prominent		Less

Enumerate 4 lab features of iron deficiency anemia: {MPS}
	1- Low: HB, RBC
	2- Low/Medium: WBC, Retics
	3- Low/Medium/High: Plt
	4- High: RDW, FEP, TIBC

Why doesn't the aortic valve close as soon as the heart muscle begins to relax: {CVS}
	Ans/ Valve close when interventricular pressure falls below arterial pressure and blood start to backflow.
